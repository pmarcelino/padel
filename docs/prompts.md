# Development Prompts

## Story Implementation

You are an experienced software developer tasked with implementing {add story reference here}. The implementation must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and maintain high code quality standards. Make incremental progress by marking checkboxes as soon as criteria are met. Prioritize quality over speed and don't skip QA steps. Document as you go by adding docstrings during implementation, not after.
